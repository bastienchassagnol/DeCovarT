\arguments{
\item{signature_matrix}{Parameter \code{mu}: \eqn{\boldsymbol{\mu}=(\mu_{g,j}) \in \mathbb{R}^{G \times J}},
storing in each each column the averaged expression of the \code{G} genes used to deconvolve all cell populations.
Name your \code{colnames} as the cell populations, and provide \code{rownames} argument for the name of the genes.
By convention, we use HGNC symbols.}

\item{bulk_expression}{Parameter \code{y}: \eqn{\boldsymbol{y}=(\mu_{g,i}) \in \mathbb{R}^{G \times I}},
storing in each each column the measured expression of the \code{G} genes in a heterogeneous sample, using any RNASeq or microarray technology.
Provide the sample ID for each of your samples in column, and the name of your genes in rownames.}

\item{scaled}{Whether we should scale or not the dataset. By default, we consider that the provided dataset is in its original raw space,
and we do not scale the dataset, since our deconvolution algorithm assumes a multivariate Gaussian distribution on the raw counts themselves.}

\item{true_ratios}{If available (for instance, in the context of a virtual benchmark, or if some standard cytometry techniques provide them),
vector of size \eqn{J}, storing the normalised proportions of the cell populations supposed present in the sample. Summary metrics
will then be computed against the ones returned by the deconvolution algorithms provided.}

\item{Sigma}{Only relevant for deconvolution algorithms which require a prior estimate
of the transcriptomic  covariance for each of the purified cell populations}

\item{deconvolution_functions}{The deconvolution functions themselves, as reported in}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} storing for each row the measured cell proportions, as well as some summary metrics
}
