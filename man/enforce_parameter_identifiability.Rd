\usage{
enforce_parameter_identifiability(theta)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{estimation of the parameters returned either by an initialisation
algorithm or by an EM algorithm on an univariate or multivariate GMM MLE estimation
\itemize{
\item The proportions \code{p}: \eqn{p} of each component (must be included between 0 and 1, and sum to one overall)
\item The mean matrix \code{mu}: \eqn{\mathrm{\mu}=(\mu_{i,j}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}}, with each column
giving the mean values of the variables within a given component
\item The 3-dimensional covariance matrix array \code{Sigma}: \eqn{\mathrm{\Sigma}=(\Sigma_{i,j,l}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n \times k}}, with each matrix
\eqn{\Sigma_{..l}, l \in \{ 1, \ldots, k\}} storing the covariance matrix of a given component,
whose diagonal terms correspond to the variance of each variable, and off-terms diagonal elements return the covariance matrix
}}
}
\value{
a list of the estimates, uniquely identified, by ranking each component
based on the ordering of their means
}
\description{
This step ensures that the estimates returned are uniquely ordered by
partial ordering on the means, and that the sum-o-one constraint, that may
be violated by numerical artefacts, is enforced
