CIBERSORT;reference-based;"$\nu$-SVR with linear kernel. The most relevant genes are referred to as ""support vector""";Newman et al., 2015;Registration as a student for a free use  of the original R code;deconvolute_ratios_CIBERSORT
CIBERSORTx;unsupervised with priors;Natural extension of CIBERSORT + possibility to infer the purified gene expression profiles + batch correction, performed with COMBAT, to accout for distinct sequencing strategies;Newman et al., 2019;For a free use, same rule applies as CIBERSORT. However, original code is not provided, but instead, a self-containaing docker is supplied.;redcross
DSection;unsupervised with priors;Bayesian framework where a prior Dirichlet, possibly noisy, is assumed on the distribution of the cellular ratios and an univariate normal prior with parameters extracted from LS solution assuming known cell-type proportions. Unknown parameters estimated using Metropolis-Hastings sampling.;Erkkila et al., 2010;http://informatics.systemsbiology.net/DSection/     ;redcross
DeMix / DeMixt;unsupervised with priors;Designed to infer the tumoral proportion of a sample. Neither reference profiles nor mixing proportions are required but the tool can take advantage of it as strong priors. Extension to a three-component, with an additional unknown cell content has been supplied with natural extension DeMixt. Mixture is modelled as a convolution of indepent, univariate log-Normal distributions.;Ahn et al., 2013 / Wang et al., 2019;https://github.com/wwylab/DeMix;redcross
MCP-counter;marker-based;"MCP scores: a) were computed using log2 geometric mean of set of markers; b) correlated to known RNA proportions in the mixture.";Becht et al., 2016;http://134.157.229.105:3838/webMCP/ (R shiny app);redcross
xCell;marker-based;"xCell is a recently published method based on ssGSEA.The xCell abundance scores are computed through the following steps: ssGSEA is performed independently and averaged  for each of the 489 gene sets implemented in the GSVA R package then averaged over a cell type; platform-specific corrections as well as ""spillover"" contaminations to account for closely related cell types are then corried out. Abundance scores are returned for 64 immune cell types. ";Aran et al., 2017;https://github.com/dviraran/xCell;redcross

PERT;Considers presence of new (a priori unknown) CT and accounts for expression deviations from the reference profiles calculating a genome-wide perturbation factor across all CT. They aim to estimate a perturbation factor for each reference population. PERT accounts for differences in experimental conditions across different expression profiles performing batch-effect removal.;Qiao et al., 2012;Supplemental material (Program S3): Octave program for PERT.;;
